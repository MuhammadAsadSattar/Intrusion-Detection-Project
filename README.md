# Network Analysis and Intrusion Detection Using Signatures and Machine Learning

## Introduction:
This repository has source code and documentation for the Project of network analysis and intrusion detection using signatures. This project uses a combination of both signature-based and machine learning to improve the security of computer networks. An overview of getting started and instructions were given in this README file.

### Project Overview:
Network security is the main topic nowadays in the interconnected world. Intrusion detection systems are an important tool for the safety of computer networks. In order to successfully identify and respond to network intrusions, this project intends to develop a powerful IDS that makes use of both signature-based detection and machine learning-based detection.

#### Key Features:
**Signature-based Detection:** 
Compares network traffic with predefined signatures for known types of attack patterns.

**Machine Learning-based Detection:** 
Uses machine learning methods to detect anomalies in the systems and learn about typical networks.

**Alerting and Reporting:** 
The system enables rapid response and generates warnings and reports of identified intrusions.

## Installation:
To set up the project locally, follow these instructions:

Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAsadSattar/Intrusion-Detection-Project

**Install required dependencies:** 
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Configure and modify the system files as needed.
3. Download and prepare the datasets.
4. Train ML models and update the signatures if required.
5. Run the IDS using the provided commands and the scripts needed.


### Data Sources:
For effective intrusion detection, datasets are used for network traffic, which includes both normal and malicious traffic are :
